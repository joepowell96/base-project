# base-project
A simple project to clone to help set up your own project.

Once you have cloned this project you can then run the following command to rename it.
```
sh renameProject.sh {new project name}
```
If you want to rename the project after having already renamed it, run the following command.
```
sh renameProject.sh {new project name} {old project name}
```
## Example renaming

Say we want to rename this project to foo, we would type the following command.
```
sh renameProject.sh foo
```
